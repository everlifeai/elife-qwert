**QWERT** is a simple GUI interface that you can use to communicate with your
avatar. For more sophisticated interfaces you can use other channels
like Telegram, Facebook and so on. But for a simple, basic way to just
get started **QWERT** is the way to go.

This repository contains the channel that communicates with the
**QWERT** interface so you can talk with your avatar.
